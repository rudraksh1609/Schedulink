# Schedulink
The Schedulink repository contains front-end files (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) for a clean user interface and JavaScript files implementing four CPU scheduling algorithms. It is structured to support easy integration of additional algorithms and future feature enhancements.


Schedulink is an interactive web-based CPU scheduling simulator designed to help users understand and compare different scheduling algorithms. The tool allows users to input process details, select from multiple algorithms including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, and Round Robin, and view real-time calculations of key metrics like completion time, turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, Schedulink features a clean, responsive interface and dynamic result visualization, making it an effective educational resource for students and developers learning about CPU process scheduling.
